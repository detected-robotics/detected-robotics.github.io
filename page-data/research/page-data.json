For this, we fully implemented a pathfinding software module for DetectED. The navigation solution as a whole requires all three of the following to work: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), path planning, visitation tracking and trajectory following/local planner. For localization and mapping we are using the TurtleBot&#39;s on board LIDAR, gryo, wheel odometry, and the gmapping suite from ROS. Our path planning solution places waypoints on the map and visits them sequentially. It then looks at cells in the map not visited and sets a waypoint to a group of unvisited pixels. Once visited, this process repeats until the map is fully visited.</p><p>During research, a problem with the robot&#39;s movement being jittery was encountered. This was addressed by implementing a custom LIDAR filter to filter self-reflections and detections of the robot itself. This improved the speed, reliability and positional accuracy of the robot.</p><p>Below is displayed the navigation of DetectED in simulation software.</p><p>In dark blue: local cast-map. Little green dots are lidar measurements. Yellow line: local planner. Blue line: global planner.</p><p>The local cast-map weights paths further from walls as preferable and finds the best (local) path for the given area. This is also used for object avoidance. Lidar measurements are used for Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). The Local / Global Planner defines the actual path to follow between defined points.</p><h3>Metal Detection</h3><p>The metal detection component is vital for the collection of FOD as only detected FOD will be swept up. To this end, DetectED needed a custom-made industry-standard metal detector which can be adjusted to FOD environment needs. Above can be seen the schema we used to develop such metal detecting component:</p><p>During research and development, an issue was encountered: the heat of temperature of metal detector components would affect the signal strength (see graph of the signal strength below). To overcome this issue, we deployed a different coil.</p><p>Furthermore, we implemented a custom signal filter which filters out noise of the metal detector.</p><h3>Collection Mechanism</h3><p>The collection mechanism is another vital part of DetectED. We 3D modelled a collection box which can hold collected FOD. 3D modelling was a crucial aspect of this process as the custom made component perfectly fits in with the rest of DetectED. For the sweeping motion of DetectED, we developed a script which mimics a sweeping motion for the robot arm. The script passes positional information to each joint node of the arm.</p><p></p><p></p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"04a4fce8-719a-5e72-a856-f8c2fcd2a682","slug":"research","__params":{"slug":"research"}}},
